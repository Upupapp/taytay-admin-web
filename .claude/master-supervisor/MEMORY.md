# Master Supervisor — Recovery Checkpoint

Compact state for resuming this build. Not a transcript. The authoritative
records are `CLAUDE.md` (the constitution), `docs/reference-audit/decision-log.md`
(DL-01..DL-79) and the git history.

## Master Command

`Taytay_Rizal_LGUIDS_Admin_Portal_Master_Command_LATEST.pdf` — LGU IDS Taytay
Rizal Social Welfare Admin portal. Angular only. 26 TABs: 01–23 original,
24–26 late-phase (Newsfeed, Events).

Reference hierarchy: **Esperanza** = features/domain, **Get Hired** = design and
interaction, **Taytay Rizal** = branding, **Angular** = framework. Neither
reference repo is reachable in this environment; both were treated as documented
intent through the audit in `docs/reference-audit/`.

## Where the build is

- **Completed and certified:** TABs 01–14.
- **Current:** TAB 15 — Referrals, Service Providers & Inter-Office Coordination.
- **Remaining:** 16–23 (field visits, releases, tasks, reports, search,
  users/audit, hardening, QA), then 24–26 (Newsfeed, Events).

## Architecture

Angular 20, standalone components, signals for view state, typed reactive forms,
lazy feature routes, strict TypeScript. No NgModules.

```
src/app/
  core/      app-level services, guards, interceptors
  data/      adapters + in-memory seed; the only place mock data lives
  domain/    entities, policy functions, ports (repository interfaces)
  features/  lazy route pages
  layout/    the shell
  shared/    reusable UI primitives
```

**The seam that matters:** views never touch data directly. Every feature reads
through a **port** (`domain/ports`) implemented by an adapter in `data/`. Swapping
in a real API is an adapter change, not a view change.

**Policy lives in `domain/`, never in a component.** Components render what they
are handed.

## Non-negotiables carried by build checkers

`npm run verify` = lint + typecheck + 10 checkers + 944 tests + build. Each
checker was validated against planted regressions. Do not weaken one to pass.

| Checker | Refuses |
| --- | --- |
| `check:brand` | a modified official seal; missing attribution |
| `check:shell` | shell a11y regressions |
| `check:access` | a permission-gated action reachable without its guard |
| `check:vulnerability` | an indicator that decides eligibility |
| `check:case-audit` | a case mutation with no appended event and reason |
| `check:intake` | an advisory rendered as a verdict |
| `check:programs` | a component branching on a programme code; a national programme recorded as one the municipality runs |
| `check:beneficiary` | a `BeneficiaryId`; any merge or delete of a person; a match signal carrying a value; a stored standing flag |
| `check:documents` | removing a document version; an unexplained replacement; a raw document number in a template; a decision-shaped completion field |

## Doctrines that constrain every later TAB

1. **Guidance never gates.** No score, indicator or checklist may decide
   eligibility. A licensed social worker decides. (`DL-42`, `DL-60`, `DL-66`)
2. **Say whose programme it is.** AICS is DSWD-administered with
   DSWD-disbursed funds; the LGU refers and may augment. (`DL-65`)
3. **Every material mutation appends an event with a reason.** History is
   append-only; nothing is rewritten. (`DL-54`)
4. **Closure is terminal.** A later need opens a linked successor case via
   `continuesCaseId`. (`DL-53`, `DL-64`)
5. **Permission denial does not leak the record.** Withheld is shown as
   withheld, never silently removed. (`DL-58`)
6. **Unverified citations are labelled.** This run is offline; every
   supervisor-supplied source carries `verifiedOn: null` and the screen says so.
   (`CLAUDE.md` §6)
7. **Separation of duties.** No single non-administrator role both approves a
   request and releases its assistance.
8. **One person, one record.** No entity duplicates a person. A beneficiary is a
   *standing* derived from records, keyed on `ResidentId`; identity findings
   supersede without deleting. (`DL-71`, `DL-74`)
9. **Assemble a fact once.** `historySummaryFor` is the single history
   assembly, shared by the resident profile and the beneficiary record. Two
   assemblies of the same fact eventually disagree in front of a family.

## Known gaps (deliberate, carried forward)

- **Linking a request to a case is not buildable from the UI.** When built it
  takes a reason and appends an event — never auto-attachment. (`DL-70`)
- **Opening a successor case** has no screen yet. (`DL-64`)
- **Enrollment is read-only.** States exist and are validated; no screen records
  an enrollment or an exit. (`DL-75`)
- **An identity finding cannot be corrected.** The opposite verdict is refused
  rather than silently applied; the correction screen is missing. (`DL-74`)
- **`beneficiary.export` has no export yet** — it exists for the reporting TAB.
- **No document upload form.** Port, adapter, validation and version history are
  built and tested; the screen that captures a file is not. (`DL-77`)
- **Document requests are callable but not composed from the UI.**
- **`redactedForSharing` is a flag**, not a renderer — the redacted copy is
  backend work.

## Next action

Begin TAB 15 — Referrals, Service Providers & Inter-Office Coordination. Inspect
what exists first: `domain/referrals/referral.ts` already holds `Referral`,
`ReferralDestination` and `ReferralStatus` with a catalog, `ReferralRepository`
already offers `list`/`getById`, seeds exist in `referrals.seed.ts`, and the
`/referrals` route is still a placeholder. **Extend that model; do not start a
second one.**

The tab's load-bearing constraints, in order of how easily they are lost:

1. **Minimum necessary disclosure.** A referral summary leaves the building. It
   shows only what the receiving office needs, and sensitive attachments are
   opt-in and permission-gated. `DL-77`'s access grant is the pattern to reuse.
2. **Every referral traces to a case or client**, and overdue ones surface in
   work queues — which means the queue shape from TAB 10 rather than a new one.
3. **Status compatibility.** Referral statuses map onto the universal vocabulary
   rather than fragmenting it; the existing `ReferralStatus` catalog already
   does this and should not be widened casually.
4. Outcome capture is a recorded act with a reason, like every other mutation
   here (`DL-54`).

## Git

- Branch `main`, no remote configured. **Never push.**
- HEAD at TAB 14 certification: `a07d929`.
- Working tree clean.
